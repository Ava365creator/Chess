# Chess — chess-web

This is a minimal client-side chess web app using chess.js (for rules) and chessboard.js (for the board). It is intentionally small so you can run and extend it.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — basic styling
- `app.js` — UI logic wiring chess.js and chessboard.js

How to view locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local dev server).
2. Play by dragging pieces. Buttons: New Game, Undo.

Notes:
- This uses CDN links for `chess.js` and `chessboard.js` in `index.html`.
- To host from GitHub Pages, enable Pages in the repo settings and set branch to `main` (or `gh-pages`).
